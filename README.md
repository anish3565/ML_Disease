# üß† ML_Disease

A comprehensive collection of machine learning models designed to predict and detect various diseases using publicly available datasets. This repository serves as a centralized hub for disease prediction projects, each focusing on a specific medical condition.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories, each corresponding to a specific disease:

- `ALZHEIMERS_DETECTION`
- `ASTHMA_PREDICTION`
- `CHRONIC_KIDNEY_DISEASE_PREDICTION`
- `DIABETES_DETECTION`
- `HEART_DISEASE_PREDICTION`
- `LIVER_DISEASE_PREDICTION`
- `LUNG_CANCER_DETECTION`
- `PARKINSON_DETECTION`

Each directory contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) that include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and conclusions.

## üìä Datasets

The datasets used for these projects are sourced from reputable platforms such as Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository. For detailed information and links to each dataset, refer to the `Dataset Links.docx` file included in the repository.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anish3565/ML_Disease.git
   cd ML_Disease
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Navigate to the disease-specific directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   cd DIABETES_DETECTION
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Repeat this step for other disease directories as needed.

## üìà Model Evaluation

Each project includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess model performance. Visualizations are provided to aid in understanding the results.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or additional disease prediction models, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
